# Market Failure

Notes, Key Points, Paper 2 Tips & Sample Questions

## Summarized Notes

### Taxes & Subsidies

#### Taxes

-   Governments impose indirect tax to create government revenue, discourage consumption of certain demerit goods, to redistribute income and a method of improving the allocation of resources.
-   When a specific tax is imposed, consumers pay more and consume less. Producers receive less revenue and sell less products/services. The government receives tax revenue and workers receive lower wages due to reduced total producer revenue. Society as a whole loses allocating efficiency. However, it can be compensated.

#### Subsidies

-   Governments provide subsidies for three main reasons: Lower price of an essential good, guarantee supplies that are necessary and enable producers to compete with overseas trade.
-   When evaluating a subsidy, the opportunity cost from providing other firms subsidies, damage done to foreign producers, players paying taxes and the efficiency/decreased incentive created.

### Price Controls

#### Price Ceilings

-   Governments impose price ceilings to help consumers obtain necessity and merit goods at a cheaper price.
-   There can be consequences caused by price ceilings aside from a shortage in the market. Price ceilings can create an underground market, create queues for producers and cause unfairness in distribution of limited goods.
-   When a price ceiling is imposed, consumers partly gain and partly lose where some consumers gain extra surplus by purchasing the product at a lower price. However, the shortage caused other consumers to have no access at all to the product or service and remain unsatisfied. Society experiences a loss in allocating efficiency (deadweight loss). Workers might get fired due to a reduction of quantity supplied and loss in total producer revenue. Governments do not gain nor lose economically but can gain political popularity amongst consumers who benefitted.
-   To eliminate or reduce the shortage caused by a price ceiling governments can: find ways to reduce demand for a product but this limits the consumption of a product, find ways to increase the supply of the product through subsidies and direct provision.

#### Price Floors

-   Price floors are imposed to raise income for producers of goods and services that the government thinks are important and to protect workers by setting a minimum wage that ensures they can live a reasonable life. Some examples of price floors are minimum wages for workers, minimum prices for agricultural goods and minimum prices for alcohol.
-   Price floors will create inefficiency due to a surplus. Governments can use the following four ways to address the surplus: buying up the surplus (store, destroy or sell to other countries), increasing demand through advertising, restricting overseas imports or imposing a producer quota.
-   A minimum wage is a type of price floor, the minimum price for a market of a factor of production: labour. A minimum wage can increase income for low-paid workers, increase labour productivity, offset employer power-imbalance and increase incentive for people to enter the labour market. However, a minimum wage can cause unemployment in competitive markets, encourage the creation of informal/illegal labour markets, destruction of small businesses and higher prices for firms to pass on to consumers.

### Negative & Positive Externalities

-   When society doesn't take into account externalities, it leads to market failure.

#### Negative Externalities

-   Negative externalities of production is a cost that is suffered by a third party as a result of production of a good or service. An example would be the production of steel where toxic chemicals are produced for society.
-   When negative externalities of production are not recognized, an overproduction of that good or service will cause allocating inefficiency or welfare loss. There will be two optimums: the market equilibrium and the social equilibrium where it's the social optimum. In this situation, no party can benefit more without harming another by changing its production/consumption.
-   Solutions to negative production externalities are government regulation for producers, indirect taxations or a market for the externality.
-   Tradable permits can be issued to firms to create a market for pollution. This creates a quota for each firm on their pollution and incentives firms to pollute less since permits can be sold for money.
-   Negative externalities of consumption happen on the consumer side where consumers harm others by consuming more of a product or service, such as smoking.
-   An overconsumption will happen and cause deadweight loss which leads to allocative inefficiency. In the case of demerit goods, they are overproduced by the market and over-consumed by consumers because they often have unrecognized negative externalities of consumption and people just don't care about the harmful effects upon themselves and others.
-   To combat negative consumption externalities, governments can create legislation banning or reducing consumption, imposing taxes for certain demerit goods, provide education/advertisement to society or use consumer nudges to make consumers voluntarily reduce consumption.

#### Positive Externalities

-   Positive externalities is when the side-effect on a third party that's not a producer or a consumer that pays to consume a product or service is beneficial.
-   When a firm produces a good or service and there is a positive benefit to third parties such as society a positive externality of production is present. This often leads to a situation where the cost to the private individuals is higher than the cost to society and creates an underproduction of said product or service which leads to deadweight loss or potential welfare gain.
-   To combat positive externalities of production, governments can directly provide the good or service through direct provision or provide subsidies to firms.
-   Positive externalities of consumption are benefits to third parties when a good or service is consumed. This leads to a situation where the benefit to society is greater than the benefit to the private consumer thus an under-consumption often happens. This also causes deadweight loss or potential welfare gain.
-   In the case of merit goods, they are often services that benefit society as a whole more than the consumer such as education, healthcare, sport facilities etc. They are often under consumed because of a lack of recognition, low levels of income and poverty and blatant consumer ignorance.
-   To combat positive externalities of consumption, governments can create legislation to consume more, positive advertising, direct government provision for certain products or services or subsidies.

### Common Pool Resources & Public Goods

#### Common Pool Resources

-   Common pool resources are non-excludable and rival and that's why the main consequence in the absence of government intervention is resource degradation.
-   Common pool resources are very susceptible to negative externalities (both production and consumption) because they are non-excludable so overconsumption/overproduction will occur.
-   The tragedy of the commons refers to the consequences of non-excludability of common resources. When a party simply "losses" in self-interest if one does not consume more of a common pool resource which causes exhaustion of limited resources.
-   The free rider problem is when parties consider society as a whole and do not act upon self-interest, other "free riders" will simply consume/produce more of the common pool resources with no consequences.
-   To combat the tragedy of the commons International agreements, tradable permits, carbon taxes, legislation/regulations, subsidies and collective self governance are often used.

#### Public Goods

-   Public goods often cause market failure because there is no profit incentive and usually can't be provided by any market. Some examples are street lights, breathable air, lighthouses and national defense.
-   Public goods have two key characteristics of being non-excludable and non-rival. One cannot reasonably stop another from using the resource and when one person uses the good, others can still use the good.
-   To combat the issue of public goods, governments often resort to direct provision or heavy subsidies or work in partnership with firms in the private sector.

### Asymmetric Information

-   Asymmetric information refers to a situation when one party to an economic transaction possesses greater material knowledge than the other party.
-   Asymmetric information often causes market failure due to two reasons: Uncertainty of the buyer will drive prices down across the whole market. This will further cause the market to collapse and no trade will occur at any price point.
-   Due to asymmetric information, when consumers know more than the producers, there will be a selection of who to provide a good/service to, or there will be a price raise since consumers who need the good/service to will use it more (ie. less healthy people and health insurance)
-   An example of adverse selection would be insurance companies choosing who to sell their product to or creating unreasonable prices for people who the company thinks is not safe to sell the product in an attempt to scare them away from purchasing.
-   The most important way to combat asymmetric information is signalling. For example sellers are required to tell buyers the condition of each car, life insurance companies require customers to do health checkups before selling them products etc.
-   Moral hazards are situations where one person is trying to get another person to behave in a certain way but if the first person cannot observe the second person's work and the second person needs to put effort into said work, the second person can simply avoid work.
-   Both moral hazards and adverse selection can cause market failure. In the case of adverse selection, the market failure occurs before an economic transaction has been made. One party has more information than the other, and this gives the party an advantage going into the transaction. In the case of moral hazard, the market failure occurs after the economic transaction has been made. The party with greater knowledge of the risk has the advantage following the transaction.
